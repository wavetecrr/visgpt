# VisGPT, the continuation of the vscode-chatgpt project!

Welcome to the official website of VisGPT! The open sourced version vscode-chatgpt being maintained by WavetecRR!

## What is it exactly?

VisGPT is a contiunation of the failed vscode-chatgpt project, which allowed Visual Studio to have some sort of ChatGPT intergration.

## So, what does it do?

- ➕ Use GPT-4, GPT-3.5, GPT3 or Codex models using your OpenAI API Key
- 📃 Get streaming answers to your prompts in sidebar conversation window
- 🔥 Stop the responses to save your tokens.
- 📝 Create files or fix your code with one click or with keyboard shortcuts.
- ➡️ Export all your conversation history at once in Markdown format.
- Automatic partial code response detection. Continues and combines automatically, when response is cut off.
- Ad-hoc prompt prefixes for you to customize what you are asking ChatGPT
- Edit and resend a previous prompt
- Copy, insert or create new file from the code, ChatGPT is suggesting right into your editor.

## How do you build it?

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- On the root directory, run `yarn` command to install the dependencies listed in `package.json`
- Within VS Code - run the project by simply hitting `F5`

## How can you install it locally?

- Install `vsce` if you don't have it on your machine (The Visual Studio Code Extension Manager)
  - `npm install --global vsce`
- Run `vsce package`
- Follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix">instructions</a> and install manually.
